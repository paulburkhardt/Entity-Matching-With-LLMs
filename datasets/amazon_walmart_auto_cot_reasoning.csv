Description: dymo by pelouze heavy duty electronic utility scale available in 150 lb or 400 lb weight capacity for heavy packages and containers weighs items in 0 2 lb or 0 1 kg increments shock resistant weigh mechanism remote lcd display head for eye level view

A: Let's think step by step! First, we can compare the titles of the two products. While both mention ""dymo"" and ""pelouze,"" the first product specifically mentions the model number ""4040"" and ""digital shipping scale,"" while the second product mentions ""heavy duty electronic utility scale"" and offers two weight capacity options.

Next, we can compare the descriptions. The first product mentions a capacity of 400 pounds, a ribbed platform for strength, and a wall-mount LCD display with a nine-foot cable. The second product mentions weight capacities of 150 or 400 pounds, shock-resistant weigh mechanism, and a remote LCD display head for eye-level view.

Based on these differences, it seems that the two products are not exactly the same. While they may have some similar features, such as being electronic scales made by the same brand, they have different model numbers, weight capacities, and specific features.
