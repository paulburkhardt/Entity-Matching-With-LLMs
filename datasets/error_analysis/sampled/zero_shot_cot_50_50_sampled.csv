- The ""Title"" attribute is somewhat important as it provides a brief description of the product. The titles of the two products are different.
- The ""Description"" attribute is also somewhat important as it provides more detailed information about the product. One product has a description while the other does not.
- The ""Color"" attribute is somewhat important as it indicates the color of the border of the film. One product has a black border while the other does not mention the color of the border.
- The ""Exposures"" attribute is important as it indicates the number of exposures in each pack. Both products have 10 exposures.
- The ""Border"" attribute is somewhat important as it indicates the presence or absence of a border on the film. One product has a black border while the other does not mention the border.","[{""attribute"":""brand"",""importance"":""0.30"",""values"":[""Fujifilm Instax"",""Instax Fujifilm""]},

- The ""Noise Canceling"" and ""Wideband"" attributes have a lower importance score of 0.2 because they are additional features that may or may not be present in the product.
