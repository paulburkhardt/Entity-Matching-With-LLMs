The first product is a pack of Fujifilm Instax Mini instant film in monochrome (black and white) for use with Fujifilm Mini instant cameras. The second product is a Garmin Vivoactive 3 GPS smartwatch with a heart rate monitor. \\nBased on this information, we can conclude that the two products are not the same. They are completely different items from different categories.\\nThe two products do not match.\n",
